    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <p>We developed an event identity to provide a strong theme that employees could empathise with, and continue to be motivated by post event. An experiential tunnel saw the employees using UV torches to discover historic advertising and poignant quotes, while listening to nostalgic adverts and jingles. This took them back to their roots and reminded them of past success. In the main room the audience were fully immersed in the business plan. Content was projection mapped across a huge 3D stage and interactivity was encouraged through Q&A and workshop sessions.</p>

        <h4>The Result</h4>
        <p>The European President said it was the best conference he'd been to in 10 years. 88% of attendees felt they left the conference with a stronger belief in the Kellogg's brand and a winning mindset for 2012. Employees felt fully informed of the route the business would take in 2012 and an illustration, produced by a live scribe during the event, hangs in the Kellogg's Manchester HQ, reminding everyone of key messages and presentations.</p>
