    <h4>The Brief</h4>
    <p>In 2011 one of our global clients launched their long-term Vision. Although the vision is well known and understood across the business, they wanted to move from understanding to buy-in and commitment.</p>

    <h4>The Solution</h4>
    <p>We wanted all 800 of their employees to own their vision, understand their responsibility and feel empowered to deliver it, so we created a challenge entitled ‘Can you cut it?’. The challenge was for individual teams to take the vision statement and bring it to life by creating a 30 second viral film.’</p>
